# tweet rain

These are Nebri instances working to tweet rain-related weather information using feeds
from Yahoo! Weather on top of [yweather] [1] and [twitter] [2] Python packages.

yweather scripts
================
The first script `yweather_scrapper` is for getting weather info based-on location. I then
make *Nebri drips* for two locations of my interest where I commute and live, the city of
Jakarta and Bogor.
